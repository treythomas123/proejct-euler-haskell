-- Solution to Project Euler problem 36
-- By Trey Thomas
--
-- The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001â‚‚ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.
--
-- Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in
-- base 10 and base 2.
--
-- (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include
-- leading zeros.)
